# Swahili_News_Classification
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for multi-class classification of Swahili news articles. The goal is to categorize news content into five topics: kitaifa, michezo, biashara, kimataifa, and burudani.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end approach including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing for Swahili text

TF-IDF vectorization (word and bigram features)

Multi-class Logistic Regression classifier

Stratified K-Fold cross-validation for reliable evaluation

Out-of-fold predictions and test submission generation

Objective:
The model is designed for the Zindi Swahili News Classification Competition
 and emphasizes both accuracy and responsible AI practices, while supporting African language representation in technology.
